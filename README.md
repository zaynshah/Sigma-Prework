# Prework code

This repository contains two pre-work coding challenges.

**Task 1**
Task 1 is to write a short program that, when given a date, calculates the age between the current date and the given date. 

An example of an input and output might look like this: 

1990-01-01 should return 31
1972-12-04 should return 48 (this is the date format required to use Date.parse())

**Task 2**
Given an array of integers, return the highest and lowest numbers in the array (without using Math.max() or Math.min())

Some example inputs and outputs would look like the below:

[2, 4, 1, 0, 2, -1] should return [-1, 4]
[20, 50, 12, 6, 14, 8] should return [6, 50]
